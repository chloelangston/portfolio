According to research, it is likely that [more people fear public speaking than death](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-real-story-risk/201211/the-thing-we-fear-more-death). Yet, similar to death, we cannot escape public speaking. Our friends get married, our bosses request presentations, our… [add]. Most of us suffer through it. The real trick is to find a way to enjoy it.

Imagine you are handed a speech that you'll be giving in one hour. Queue heart racing and labored breathing. Similar to a bedtime routine of teeth brushing and flossing, many public speakers have found success in building a simple and automatic pre-speech routine to curb stress. These routines consists of science-backed or expert-approved actions that enhance calm and confidence.

<!-- Most of the visceral misery of public speaking - shaking hands, exploding heart, panicked voice - can be completely avoided through tricks and I've compiled them into ~ [the routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPoOv4vY2Lw) ~ below. -->

Below is an example schedule for a speech given today at 7:00pm.  

**6:00pm: Imagine the audience**. Veronica Kwaitkowski, a standup comedian in New York, explained that before she goes on stage, she always remembers that the audience wants her to succeed. Most often, the relationship between audience and public speaker is that of love, friendship, admiration, or professional respect. The audience members want the speaker to do well and succeed. Try it:
> * Picture who will be in the crowd
> * Imagine their well wishes

**6:30pm: Power pose**. [Amy Cuddy's TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks-_Mh1QhMc) explains how just *posture* will change your body's chemistry and pump the breaks on your stress response. Decreasing cortisol, the stress hormone, and increasing testosterone, the dominance hormone, provides for a perfect calm and confident disposition. Try it:
> * Stand in front of a mirror
> * Place your feet shoulder width apart
> * Become as tall and straight as possible
> * Place your hands on your hips like Superman
> * Put a timer on for 2 minutes


**6:58pm: Belly breathe**: This discreet magic trick instantly reduces stress. As [mentioned in Psychology Today](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-athletes-way/201705/diaphragmatic-breathing-exercises-and-your-vagus-nerve?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR2WKa1Ex0EPzgft856N41fMEf6yucSp-OH9YZXLRHkc0oWkbvV6p_jnIHY_aem_AxrV_ZTfjMuqLzcFRd3CIw), the timeless technique is rooted in Eastern culture, and the effects of which have also been confirmed through scientific research. Also called diaphragmatic breathing or slow abdominal breathing, the practice brings the mind back to the body, lowers the heart rate and stimulates the vagus nerve which reduces stress. Try it:  
> * Sit up straight  
> * Place your hand on your upper stomach, at the bottom of your rib cage, over your diaphragm  
> * Breathe slowly and deeply. When you breathe in, push out your diaphragm more than you usually would  
> * Focus only on the feeling of your hand on your stomach as it moves  
> * If your mind drifts, that’s ok, just bring it back to your hand on your stomach  
> * Do this for about 30 seconds  

**7pm: Speak from your diaphragm**: At the beginning of any speech, to avoid the cyclical voice shaking, I make sure to kick it off in this projecting voice. I hear myself sound confident and it increases both my actual confidence and the confidence I appear to have from the audience.
> * Sit up straight  
> * Put your hand on your diaphragm  
> * Take a deep breath in. As you breathe out, let out a sound and have it come from deep in your diaphragm. For me, it sounds a little lower and a little stronger than my normal voice

Practice this routine in your bedroom. Practice it when you practice your speech in front of friends or colleagues. Then easily pull it out on the day of your speech. I would love to hear how your practice or your speech went with this routine.
