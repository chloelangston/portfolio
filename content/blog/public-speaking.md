*Public speaking advice from a terrible public speaker*  

June, 2024

<!--more-->
According to research and surveys, it is likely that more people fear public speaking than death. Yet - similar to death - we cannot escape public speaking. Our friends get married, our bosses ask for presentations, our… [add]. So why not find a way to enjoy it?

If you already enjoy it, please move on. I get it, you've won.  

Most of the visceral misery of public speaking - shaking hands, exploding heart, panicked voice - can be completely avoided through tricks and I've compiled them into ~ [the routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPoOv4vY2Lw) ~ below.

Are you dreading it? Perfect. Try the routine and see how you feel.

#### The Routine

`1. 30 minutes before`   
**Imagine the audience**: *No one is rooting against you*  
Think of anytime you have seen a public speaker. It might have been a loved one, a friend of a friend, a colleague, or even someone you've paid to see. You want them to succeed. Most likely, the speaker isn't even a big part of your day and not someone you thought about much before or after. Try it:
> * Picture who will be in the crowd
> * Imagine their wishes for you

`2. 20 minutes before`  
**Power poses**: *Physically stop your stress response*  
I once had a thoughtful hiring manager who sent me [Amy Cuddy's TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks-_Mh1QhMc) the day before a 6 hour technical coding interview. I learned that just ***standing*** a certain way will change your body's chemistry and pump the breaks on your stress response. Try it:
> * Stand in front of a mirror
> * Become as tall and straight as possible
> * Put your feet shoulder width apart
> * Place your hands on your hips like Superman
> * Put a timer on for 2 minutes


`3. 30 seconds before`  
**Belly breathing**: *No room for anxious thoughts*  
When I was in a kid, sitting in a classroom waiting for my turn to present, my mind went something like this, “Don’t forget what you’re going to say. Start with [enter something from a book]. Hot Kevin is sitting in the front row. This is so embarrassing.”
Now my thoughts before a presentation go more like this, “………..” Try it:  
> * Sit up straight  
> * Place your hand on your upper stomach, at the bottom of your rib cage, over your diaphragm  
> * Breathe slowly and deeply. When you breathe in, push out your diaphragm more than you usually would  
> * Focus only on the feeling of your hand on your stomach as it moves  
> * If your mind drifts, that’s ok, just bring it back to your hand on your stomach  
> * Do this for about 30 seconds  

`4. 0 seconds`  
**Speak from your diaphragm**: *Set the tone*
At the beginning of any speech, to avoid the cyclical voice shaking, I make sure to kick it off in this projecting voice. I hear myself sound confident and it increases both my actual confidence and the confidence I appear to have from the audience.
> * Sit up straight  
> * Put your hand on your diaphragm  
> * Take a deep breath in. As you breathe out, let out a sound and have it come from deep in your diaphragm. For me, it sounds a little lower and a little stronger than my normal voice
