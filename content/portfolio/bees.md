#### The Process


1. Identify learning problem
    * How might we help young people learn about ways to help the environment?
2. Brainstorm solutions with learning theories in mind
    * Learn by doing
    * Self-efficacy
3. Prototype
    * I created rough prototypes just with HTML and CSS.
4. User test
    * User tests gave me insight into which parts were confusing or unnecessary and which were effective.
4. Iterate
5. User test and gather data
