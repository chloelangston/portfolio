Sustainable Stories is my master's project from Stanford. It is a collection of interactive stories about people taking positive action for the environment. The global reach of climate change as well as the global response lead to its world map design.

Each icon represents a real person who is taking a unique initiative that is:
1. Affordable
2. Replicable
3. Non-location specific (though not necessarily able to be used in every location)
4. Scientifically backed to improve the state of the environment
<br/><br/>

A user can click on an icon to be interact with the person's story and learn about both issue and their solution.

The modes of research this project is built on:
* **[Learn by doing (John Dewey)](https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-1-4419-1428-6_544)**
* **[Learning through storytelling (Jennifer Aaker)](https://womensleadership.stanford.edu/stories#:~:text=%22Stories%20are%20remembered%20up%20to,times%20more%20than%20facts%20alone.%22&text=In%20this%20way%2C%20story%20is,as%20a%20tool%20to%20persuade.)**
