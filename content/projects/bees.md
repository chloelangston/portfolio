2. Brainstorm solutions with learning theories in mind
    * Learn by doing
    * Self-efficacy
    * Learn through storytelling
3. Prototype
    * I created rough prototypes just with HTML and CSS.
4. User test
    * User tests gave me insight into which parts were confusing or unnecessary and which were effective.
4. Iterate
    * Added more creative interaction
    * Removed unnecessary longform text pieces
5. User test and gather data
    * 97% of users reported learning
