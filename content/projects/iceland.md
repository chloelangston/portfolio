During the Covid-19 pandemic, life in Iceland has remained relatively normal. Their success at keeping infections under control is partially due to having a small homogenous population that has trust in the government, but can also be credited to their rigorous contact tracing program.

To outline how their contact tracing program works, I interviewed an Icelandic citizen named Pall who experienced how the system works first-hand. Below are screen recordings of his story integrated with illustrations and scrolling effects.

After reading Pall's story, a user may further explore how the system works by interacting with a dynamic flow chart which displays what further actions the government requires depending on a situation.
